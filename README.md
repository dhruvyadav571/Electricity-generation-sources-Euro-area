# Electricity-generation-sources-Euro-area
Analyzing different sources for generation of electricity in Euro Area countries. The data analysis tools used in the project are Python, MySQL and Tableau. 

Python helped in data cleaning, filtering and sorting. It was also used in removing and renaming rows and columns. Also it helped in inserting dataset into SQL.

In MySQL, different queries were written and executed for trend analysis, getting qualitative and quantitative data based on specific conditions and multiple SQL functions were used.

Tableau was used for data visualization and analyzing datasets through different types of visualization- bar, line and scatter charts.

The uploaded documents can help anyone to make this project themselves.
